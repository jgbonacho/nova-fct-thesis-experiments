    Apply a defuzzification rule to map fuzzy memberships to a binary [overlapping] community cover.

    Parameters:
        U : (np.ndarray | np.matrix, shape[n,k])
            Fuzzy memberships per node per community.
        gamma : (float, optional)
            Hyperparameter for the defuzzification rule.
            Default is 0.5.
        conditionally_discard_first_cluster : (bool, optional)
            If True, discard the first cluster if all membership values in the first column are positive.
            If False, include all clusters in the defuzzification process.
            Default is True.
        overlapping : (bool, optional)
            If True, apply node-wise alpha-cut thresholding.
            If False, apply maximum membership assignment.
            Default is True.

    Returns:
        predicted_labels : (list[list[int]], length n | list[int], length n)
            List of predicted labels for each node.
        first_cluster_discarded : (bool)
            Whether the first cluster was discarded.

    Exceptions:
        ValueError : If gamma is not in the range [0, 1], when overlapping is True.
